# PhotoJournel

ðŸ“‰ **PhotoJournel** is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to manage their photo collections by generating meaningful captions, extracting metadata, and creating a beautifully written journal entry.

## Features

- **Photo Management**: Upload your photos in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
- **Caption Generation**: Automatically generate meaningful captions for each photo using the BLIP model.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract metadata such as the date taken and location from the photos.
- **Journal Entry Creation**: Combine captions and metadata to create a cohesive and engaging journal entry.
- **Downloadable Entries**: Download the generated journal entry as a text file.

## Installation

    ```sh
    cd PhotoJournel
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh

## How It Works

- **Caption Generation**: Uses the BLIP model from Salesforce to generate captions based on the uploaded images.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts EXIF data from images to retrieve the date taken and GPS coordinates.
- **Journal Entry Creation**: Combines the generated captions and metadata to create a journal entry using a generative AI model configured with custom settings.
